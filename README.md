This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: attempting to access an array element beyond its bounds. The bug.as file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.as provides the corrected version.  The error arises from directly accessing myArray[myArray.length], which tries to access one element past the last valid index.  The solution shows the correct way to access the last element using myArray[myArray.length -1] or employing a check for array emptiness.
